POSITION CONTROL MODE:
- arm drone
- take off
- maneuver to desired search area
- switch to offboard mode
OFFBOARD CONTROL MODE:
- drone given pre-defined search area (length and width) and search altitude
- drone will execute a fixed-heading lawnmower search pattern
- once drone detects AprilTag, it abandons lawnmower search pattern and navigates to position itself directly above the tag
- drone will then land on the AprilTag
	- NOTE: if no landing messages found for PX4/ROS2, the drone will hover at a fixed altitude above the AprilTag, and the next two steps are to be ignored
- drone automatically disarms
- operator kills drone

TOPICS:
- needed for publishing position, velocity, acceleration, and heading:
		/fmu/in/trajectory_setpoints
- AprilTag detection:
	- in ROS 2, need to determine if the following topic shows data:
		/tf
	- on the drone itself, need to determine if the following topic shows data:
		/tag_pose
- allegedly need MavLink to land the drone... but could potentially use:
		/fmu/in/trajectory_setpoints
